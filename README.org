Several packages needed to have a reasonably OK environment to work with SUSE
packages (OBS) in Arch Linux.

* Assumptions&Warnings
- I'am focusing more on the code review&patching part.

  On my setup building is done on a =openSUSE= machine.

- =quilt setup=, =osc commit=, =osc sr(mr)=
  
  Most =osc= commands should work.

- Package building is *NOT* tested, though it should work (after all it's just
=chroot=).

- The translation part in SPEC is completely ignored.
  
  It's hard to get these right without installing many POT files. And the
  translation texts are usually not relevant for code.
  
* Usage

Just install it. Most dependences are in =AUR= though, like =rpm-org=. You may
need to manually install them.
